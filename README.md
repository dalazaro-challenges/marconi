# Marconi

**Live Demo:** http://marconi-dl.herokuapp.com/

## Coding Challenge

Review the current Marconi Website and write HTML & CSS that produces a pixel perfect replica. It is only necessary to replicate https://marconi.org – you do not need to replicate the Team page.

Add a widget to the top menu (using whatever design you see fit) that enables the user to select between English and Simplified Chinese. Leverage the react-18next framework to change the content of the hero text to it’s Chinese equivalent:

English:
A new blockchain protocol for jump starting secure networks using programmable packets

Simplified Chinese:
使用可编程数据包跳转启动安全网络的新区块链协议

*Tip: The simpler, readable and maintainable the code is, the better.*
